"""
embed_to_csv_finetuned.py - same output shape as embed_to_csv.py (block_id,
space_version, embedding), but tailored to Silk instead of generic CLIP.

v1/v2 trained the projection head on image-image pairs: two blocks in the
same channel are a positive pair, CLIP-style, nothing else. That taught the
head "these two blocks were curated together" but never once involved what
the channel was actually *about* - so a text query like "drain gang" had
nothing trained to connect it to that channel's images. Verified: v1's loss
barely moved (image content within a channel can be wildly heterogeneous - photos, memes, screenshots, no shared pixel structure), and v2's anchor term
(kept, see anchor_loss) couldn't fix a problem that was never about drift.

v3 uses the caption that was sitting right there unused: channels.csv's
`title` (e.g. "Drain Gang - Collection Archive"). Positive pairs are now
(channel title text, member image) - the exact same recipe CLIP itself was
pretrained on, just swapping "caption" for "channel title". This directly
teaches the model what a text query like "drain gang" should retrieve,
instead of hoping image-image clustering happens to transfer.

v3 still overfit: every step sampled exactly *one* random member image per
channel, so a channel with a recurring visual subtype (a merch shirt photo
reposted a dozen times in "Drain Gang") got that subtype reinforced on a
large fraction of the steps that touched it, at the expense of the channel's
actually-diverse content. Nothing regularized against this, and there was no
way to even tell it was happening beyond eyeballing a 9-image grid. v4 added
multi-image sampling, weight decay, and a held-out recall@k check - but the
measured result was recall@50 of 8.3% on TRAIN members, with the loss flat
from epoch ~15 to 50. That's not overfitting anymore, that's a model that
isn't learning enough to begin with. Two real capacity problems:

  - only 32 channels' worth of negatives per step (--channels-per-batch) is a
    weak, noisy contrastive signal - real CLIP-style training leans hard on
    large in-batch negative counts. Bumped the default way up (this is free:
    it's 512-dim vector math, not image forward passes).
  - a single 512x512 linear map has to simultaneously (a) pull ~500 distinct
    channels' worth of images toward ~500 distinct points and (b) stay close
    to its identity-initialized starting position via anchor_loss - those two
    pressures fight each other, and a plain linear map doesn't have much
    slack to satisfy both. v5 replaces it with a small residual adapter (see
    ProjectionHead): a 2-layer MLP bottleneck added on top of the identity
    path, zero-initialized so training starts as an *exact* identity function
    architecturally, not just approximately via a loss term. It can carve out
    nonlinear per-region adjustments without the tug-of-war a single matrix
    was stuck in, so anchor_weight can also come down.

CLIP stays frozen (both towers). Only a small head on the image side trains,
and it trains directly on cached 512-dim vectors - no image forward passes
after the one-time corpus embed, no GPU required, done in seconds.
